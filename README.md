ðŸŽ® Number Guessing Game in Python
This is a simple console-based number guessing game built with Python. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 200, and the user has up to 6 attempts to guess it correctly.

ðŸ§  How It Works
The game asks for your name to personalize the experience.

It randomly picks a number between 1 and 200.

You are prompted to guess the number within a maximum of 6 tries.

After each guess, the program gives you hints:

"Too low" if your guess is smaller than the number.

"Too high" if your guess is greater than the number.

If your guess is outside the 1-200 range, it prompts you to enter a valid number.

If a non-numeric input is entered, it lets you know it's invalid.

At the end, it tells you whether you guessed the number or not.

You can choose to play again after each round.
